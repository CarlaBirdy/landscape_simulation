## Introduction

In this document, we analyse the results of the simulations generated using `es_benefit.R`.

```{r load_data}
load("results/benefit_all_replicates.rda")
```

```{r manipulate_data}
res <- out %>%
  mutate(amt_scenario = case_when(p_supply == 0.1 & p_demand == 0.1 ~ "LowS_LowD",
                                  p_supply == 0.4 & p_demand == 0.1 ~ "HighS_LowD",
                                  p_supply == 0.1 & p_demand == 0.4 ~ "LowS_HighD",
                                  p_supply == 0.4 & p_demand == 0.4 ~ "HighS_HighD",
                                  TRUE ~ "None")) %>%
  select(amt_scenario, alpha, beta, gamma, rival, ee_thresh, es_thresh, f_supply, f_demand, inter, benefit, num_supply, ee_density, ee_centr_degree, ee_edge_per_node_mean, num_demand, es_density, es_centr_degree, es_edge_per_node_mean)
```
## Hypotheses development

Here, based on simulated results, we develop hypotheses about the effect of landscape structure across four dimensions: (1) the amount of supply, (2) the amount of demand, (3) fragmentation of supply, (4) fragmentation of demand, and (5) supply/demand interspersion.

Then we develop hypotheses for how these effects vary across five dimensions of ecosystem service characteristics: (1) whether supply-supply connections are spatially constrained or unconstrained, (2) whether supply-demand connection are spatially constrained or unconstrained, (3) whether supply-supply connectivity has a positive, negative or no effect on ecosystem service supply, (4) ecosystem service substitutability, and (5) ecosystem service rivalness.

First we define functions to fit the models and extract coefficient estimates. The model we fit here is a Poisson glm with a "quasipoisson" family.

```{r define_functions1, echo = TRUE}
# change here to change model structure
mod_fit <- function(dat) {
  glm(benefit ~ f_supply * inter + f_demand * inter + f_supply * f_demand + I(f_supply ^ 2) + I(f_demand ^ 2) + I(inter ^ 2), data = dat, family = "quasipoisson")
}

# change here to change variables that are scaled
scale_cols <- function(x) {
  scale_this <- function(y) as.vector(scale(y))
  mutate_at(x, .vars = vars(f_supply, f_demand, inter), .funs = funs(scale_this))
}

# change covariates and arrange() here if model structure changes for getting coefficients and standard errors
get_coefs <- function(mod) {
  data.frame(covariates = c("(Intercept)", "Frag Supply", "Inter", "Frag Demand", "Frag Supply ^ 2", "Frag Demand ^ 2", "Inter ^ 2", "Frag Supply * Inter", "Frag Demand * Inter", "Frag Supply * Frag Demand"), estimates = summary(mod)$coefficients[,1], serrors = summary(mod)$coefficients[,2]) %>% as_tibble() %>% arrange(c(1 ,2 , 6, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8))  
}
```

Next we fit the models to each amt_scenario, ee_thresh, es_thresh, beta, gamma, and rival combinations

```{r model_fits, echo = TRUE}
mod <- res %>%
  group_by(amt_scenario, ee_thresh, es_thresh, beta, gamma, rival) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(data_scaled = map(data, scale_cols),
         mod = map(data_scaled, mod_fit),
         mod_tidy = map(mod, tidy),
         mod_glance = map(mod, glance),
         mod_coefs = map(mod, get_coefs))

effects <- mod %>% select(ee_thresh, es_thresh, amt_scenario, beta, gamma, rival, mod_coefs) %>%
unnest()         
```  

Next we plot the coefficients (effect sizes) for different combinations of values for: (1) the effect of connectivity on ecosystem service supply (beta), (2) ecosystem service substitutability (gamma), and (3) rivalness (rival).

We do this for each amount scenario (i.e., amounts of supply and demand) and each spatial scale of supply-supply and supply-demand connections (i.e., whether connections are spatially constrined or not)

### LowS-LowD, scale of SS connections = 30, scale of SD connections = 30   

In this case we observe the following:

(1) The effect of supply fragmentation, fragmentation of demand and interspersion are always positive. This seems to arise because fragmentation tends to connect patches up (as measured by the edge density) and interspersion tends to connect supply and demand patches.    

(2) When the ES is substitutable (gamma = 0.1) then the effect of supply or demand fragmentation is higher when the effect of supply-supply connections are positive (beta = 0.05) than when the effect of supply-supply connections are negative (beta = -0.05). However, when ES is non-substitutable (gamma = 0.5) these effects are the other way around (i.e., the effect of supply or demand fragmentation is higher when the effect of supply-supply connections are negative (beta = -0.05) than when the effect of supply-supply connections are positive (beta = 0.05)). This may be explained by the following: When the ES is substitutable marginal values do not change very much so effects closely reflect changes in supply - greater fragmentation leads to more supply-supply connections (as measured by edge density) and this maximises the supply of the ES when the effects of supply-supply connections is positive. When the ES is not substitutable, there is a cost to fragmenting supply as it also leads to connecting supply and demand patches and reduces the marginal value of the service rapidly.          

(3) The effect of interspersion is greater than the effect of fragmentation, except when the ES is non-substitutable (gamma = 0.5) or when supply-supply connections have a positive effect on supply (beta = 0.05). This could be explained by two processes: (a) when the ES is non-substitutable there is some cost to connecting demand to supply patches as it reduces the marginal value of the service rapidly, (b) when supply-supply connections have a positive effect on supply then interspersion tends to reduce the number of supply-supply connections by spreading out supply patches.     

(4) There is a strong negative interaction between supply and demand fragmentation (i.e., the effect of supply fragmentation declines as demand fragmentation increases and vice versa).  This interaction effect seems to be smallest when the effect of supply-supply links is negative.

(5) In general being rival tends to reduce the effect of landscape structure variables on benefits (although the effects seems to be a bit variable and not large).

(6) The effect of interspersion is non-linear with maximum effects at intermediate values of interspersion (i.e., the main effect is positive and the quadratic effect is negative)        

```{r LowSLowD3030, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
#ee_thresh = 30, es_thresh = 30, amt_scenario = LowS_LowD
effects1 <- effects[effects$ee_thresh==30 & effects$es_thresh==30 & effects$amt_scenario=="LowS_LowD" & effects$covariates!="(Intercept)", ]
effects1$covariates <- factor(effects1$covariates, levels = effects1$covariates[1:9])

ggplot(effects1, aes(x = covariates, y = estimates)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = effects1$estimates - 1.96 * effects1$serrors, ymax = effects1$estimates + 1.96 * effects1$serrors), color = "black", width = .1, position = position_dodge(0.1)) + ylab("Effect size") + xlab("") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=8, angle=45, vjust=0, hjust=1)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + facet_grid(beta ~ gamma + rival, labeller = label_both)
```

### HighS-LowD, scale of SS connections = 30, scale of SD connections = 30   

In this case we observe similar patterns to the LowS-LowD case except for the following:

(1) In general the effects of landscape structure are smaller than in the LowS-LowD case.

(2) When the effect of supply-supply connection are positive and the ES is non-substitutable then the effect of interspersion is negative. Presumably this reflects the rapid decline in marginal values as you connect supply and demand patches (see comments above).

```{r HighSLowD3030, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
#ee_thresh = 30, es_thresh = 30, amt_scenario = HighS_LowD
effects1 <- effects[effects$ee_thresh==30 & effects$es_thresh==30 & effects$amt_scenario=="HighS_LowD" & effects$covariates!="(Intercept)", ]
effects1$covariates <- factor(effects1$covariates, levels = effects1$covariates[1:9])

ggplot(effects1, aes(x = covariates, y = estimates)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = effects1$estimates - 1.96 * effects1$serrors, ymax = effects1$estimates + 1.96 * effects1$serrors), color = "black", width = .1, position = position_dodge(0.1)) + ylab("Effect size") + xlab("") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=8, angle=45, vjust=0, hjust=1)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + facet_grid(beta ~ gamma + rival, labeller = label_both)
```

### LowS-HighD, scale of SS connections = 30, scale of SD connections = 30   

In this case we observe similar patterns to the LowS-LowD case except for the following:

(1) In general the effects of landscape structure are smaller than in the LowS-LowD case.

(2) Interspersion tends not to have effects any bigger then suppy and demand fragmentation.

```{r LowSHighD3030, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
#ee_thresh = 30, es_thresh = 30, amt_scenario = LowS_HighD
effects1 <- effects[effects$ee_thresh==30 & effects$es_thresh==30 & effects$amt_scenario=="LowS_HighD" & effects$covariates!="(Intercept)", ]
effects1$covariates <- factor(effects1$covariates, levels = effects1$covariates[1:9])

ggplot(effects1, aes(x = covariates, y = estimates)) + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = effects1$estimates - 1.96 * effects1$serrors, ymax = effects1$estimates + 1.96 * effects1$serrors), color = "black", width = .1, position = position_dodge(0.1)) + ylab("Effect size") + xlab("") + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text=element_text(size=8, angle=45, vjust=0, hjust=1)) + geom_hline(yintercept=0) + facet_grid(beta ~ gamma + rival, labeller = label_both)
```

## Typologies

This typology needs updating to reflect the new typology in the manuscript, but left here for now.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/typology.png')
```

In the below plots, the service types are numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom (e.g. type one is plantation forestry, type 5 is wind pollinated crops/hunting etc.).

## Sensitivity to landscape configuration parameters

For each subgroup (unique combinations of ES type based on service scenario), we fit a Poisson GLM with the landscape parameters as covariates (f_supply, f_demand, inter, amt_scenario). We also include the interaction between each configuration parameter (f_supply, f_demand, inter) and the amount scenario to get an idea of whether the relationship between landscape configuration and ES benefit changes with landscape composition.

The plots below are partial effect plots for the landscape configuration variables at each level of amount scenario.

```{r define_functions2, echo = TRUE}
# change here to change model structure
mod_fit <- function(dat) {
  glm(benefit ~ f_supply * amt_scenario + f_demand * amt_scenario + inter * amt_scenario, data = dat, family = "poisson")
}

# change here to change variables that are scaled
scale_cols <- function(x) {
  scale_this <- function(y) as.vector(scale(y))
  mutate_at(x, .vars = vars(f_supply, f_demand, inter), .funs = funs(scale_this))
}

# change here if model structure changes
get_preds <- function(mod, pred) {
  make_predictions(mod, pred = pred, modx = "amt_scenario")$predicted %>%
    mutate(covariate = pred) %>%
    select(benefit, pred = !!pred, modx_group, covariate)
}

get_all_preds <- function(mod) {
  get_preds(mod, "f_supply") %>%
    bind_rows(get_preds(mod, "f_demand")) %>%
    bind_rows(get_preds(mod, "inter"))
}
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height = 35}
mod <- res %>%
  group_by(alpha, beta, gamma, rival, ee_thresh, es_thresh) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(data_scaled = map(data, scale_cols),
         mod = map(data_scaled, mod_fit),
         mod_tidy = map(mod, tidy),
         mod_glance = map(mod, glance),
         mod_preds = map(mod, get_all_preds))

preds <- mod %>% select(alpha, beta, gamma, rival, ee_thresh, es_thresh, mod_preds) %>%
  unnest()

ggplot(preds, aes(x = pred, y = benefit, colour = covariate)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Covariate") +
  facet_grid(alpha + beta + gamma + rival + ee_thresh + es_thresh ~ modx_group, scales = "free")
```

NB The relationship between ES benefit and both fragmentation parameters is pretty similar, this is why f_demand lines are not visible. This is something worth discussing (e.g. is this to do with the way we have written the benefit function, or is it an actual result).

Below are a couple of other ways to cut the visualisation [NOTE: SEEMS TO CURRENTLY BE AN ISSUE WITH THIS CODE - NOT PRESENTLY EVALUATED]

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height = 15, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(preds, aes(x = pred, y = benefit)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(service_scenario ~ modx_group + covariate, scales = "free")
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height = 15, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(preds, aes(x = pred, y = benefit, colour = modx_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Amount Scenario") +
  facet_grid(service_scenario ~ covariate, scales = "free")
```
